# Hey, Iâ€™m Madamin ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a fullstack web developer from Uzbekistan, passionate about building clean and modern web applications, and constantly growing my skills through real-world projects.

I focus on creating fast, responsive, and modern web applications using tools like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [React Server Components](https://react.dev/learn/server-components), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), and [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com). I love transforming ideas into clean, accessible, and user-friendly experiences.

My GitHub is a collection of everything I experiment with â€” from small UI components to fullstack apps. I believe in learning by building, and Iâ€™m always looking for new things to break and rebuild better.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy exploring good UI/UX practices, reading blogs like [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) or [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), and sipping strong black tea â˜• while planning my next side project.
